## Objectives

- Define what an algorith is
- Dievise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contras problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer


### What is an algorith

**A process or set of steps to accomplish a specific task.**

##### Why do I need to do this?

- Almost everything that you do in programming involves some king of algorithm1
- It is the foundation for being a succesful problem solving and developer.
- Also, intervies

##### How do I get better at it

- Devise a plan for solving problem
- Master common problem solving problems

##### Problem solving strategies
This are just a set of steps about how to approach new problems.

- Understand the problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break it down
- Solve/ Simplify
- Look back and refactor
